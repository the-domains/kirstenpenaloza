            <title><![CDATA[Abuse in Buddhism]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0dd34fed-b489-46a3-a500-4cc190979fa7.jpg">,<h1>Abuse in Buddhism</h1>,<p>July 2017</p>,<p>I just read about the <a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/letter-to-sogyal-rinpoche-from-current-and-ex-rigpa-members-details-abuse-allegations/">open letter</a> from students of Sogyal Rinpoche, in which they mention in 12 pages physical, emotional and sexual abuse from him.</p>,<p>I have first hand experienced an abusive lama, who used his position to manipulate me into a sexual relationship. It was NOT a Rinpoche - to state this very clear! - nonetheless a lama.</p>,<p>I have also seen and experienced how high masters misuse donations to build big mansions and there are known issues with this with India's government. Such case was one in Bir, resulting in all foreign visitors having to get a permit from the government to visit Tibetan settlements, with the mean to control and track from where donations came from and what they do with them.</p>,<p>It is an "open secret" that many lamas and high masters have been using their position to abuse their students in many ways. I know of people who have been blackmailed by their sanghas to remain silent, who have been bullied and forced out of their communities when they spoke up. I also know of so many misconducts of lamas, khenpos, rinpoches, etc. who get involved with their students or even translators, with the concept of having "dakinis" and practicing "tantric forms of Buddhism".</p>,<p>We cried out loud when those behaviors became so evident in priests - we couldn't longer ignore them, when the Catholic church and community tried to silent those allegations.</p>,<p>But now that it hits home we try to ignore the facts, we blame the victims, because victim shaming is easier than to see and accept the truth, and we try to dehumanize, humiliate not only the victims, but also the "press" that publishes those articles almost in a Trumpanian way.</p>,<p>I don't know in person Sogyal Rinpoche and his sangha, and while I believe that for certain he has done many great things, I also am very reluctant to believe he is a saint. When so many people speak out, there is something behind it.</p>,<p>As Westerners we tend to romanticize Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and the culture, we put our teachers on altars and we are taught that questioning them and seeing them as impure beings is just our own dirty mind projecting our impurity to them.<br>I think this is just another way of manipulating our mind, of emotionally being blackmailed to believe we are the ones at fault.</p>,<p>Institutionalized victim shaming is the most dangerous form and although I am still a Buddhist, I still follow Tibetan Buddhism, I also refuse to be a blind follower and support this institutionalized religion.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[About death and other things]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>About death and other things</strong></h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92c2d329-b238-4bfb-9d49-a806af8d64ea.jpg">,<p>Why is it that most of the people just aren’t able to talk about death, not even&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with someone who suffered a loss and help one to get over it? What happened to the societies that made death a tabu? If we don’t even know what exactly is&nbsp;<em>death</em>, then how to understand and even harder: to accept it? We can’t even tell if it’s a process, a cycle, a situation, a moment, a fact or just a reality!<br>I remember when I just started to become a Buddhist practitioner and during the guided meditation we were “meditating on death and impermanence” we had to imagine our own moment of death, e.g. in a car accident or whatever came into our minds and observe the emerging uncomfortable sensation. It was supposed to be an aversion against this moment and death in general showing us that we are afraid of it because we haven’t really started to live. All with the final goal to understand that we need to work with our minds and transform them or ourselves in order to live meaningful. To make the story short: I had no such uncomfortable feeling. There was just nothing. No fear, no aversion, no panic. Just nothing. Now&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;worried me. It couldn’t be possible that I was so indifferent towards my own death! I approached our meditation guide and he recommended to find another way to “get close” to the idea of death in order to experience the emergency of change. Still nothing happened.</p>,<p>After one meditation class I was on my way home and passed by the entrance of a metro station. In the late rush hour were still a lot of people in hurry to reach their homes, and as it is sadly normal in big cities, no one had a look at one particular old women standing completely at a side with a shoe-box full of sweets, candies and chewing gum holding in her arms. She was just staring into huge black hole in front of her, not caring about the running people, not noticing anybody, not even making an attempt to be noticed in order to sell some candies.&nbsp;<br>The moment I saw her I started crying - just to vary a little bit. I mean, there is something about old people that makes me cry since I was a little girl. But this time I realised that I was deeply touched by her appearance because I could see my fears and neurosis in her, it was a clear moment in which I understood why I couldn’t do the meditation properly: I wasn’t afraid of dying rather than afraid of growing old alone and abandoned, unloved and uncared. I was terrified of getting old&nbsp;<em>per se</em>. And that’s why I developed the neurosis about buying, collecting and of course using all these kind of cosmetics - refreshing cream for the eyes, extreme hydrating cream for the face, a lifting body lotion and an anti cellulitis serum for butt and legs, of course the anti ageing face peeling and accordingly the body scrub, then the whole collection (obviously) of make up with the same rejuvenating attributes to hide my imperfections and to lighten my plus spots etc. etc. etc.<br>That I had taken this over from my mom, I was conscious about, but that I took this to an extreme of a neurosis, that was new for me. I understood all this just in a few seconds lasting enlightening moment, then I went over to that ancient women, gave her some coins without wanting anything and thanked her in my mind for being my precious teacher, for having taught me this priceless lesson of myself and one aspect of my dark side (maybe not the darkest, but still it was enough an obstacle to keep me from growing internally). I kept giving her money for the rest of the time I was living in Mexico City, always with the huge feeling of gratitude paired with an immense sense of compassion, wishing each time that not one single person might be alone and abandoned when old.<br>So what now? A few years later, I’m still not really afraid of death itself, but I’m afraid of what comes after and I got obsessed with this topic looked at from the Buddhist side. I took a meditation course on how to die consciously (<em>Phowa</em>) and read the Tibetan Book of Death in order to be prepared for when someone (it might be me…) dies. A few weeks later I got the news about the death of my youngest uncle in Germany. I was in Nepal, in Boudhanath to be precise, practically surrounded by Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and very close to the biggest stupa on earth. So I went to many of them to ask the monks to pray for my uncle in reward leaving a small amount of money, I went to the stupa to lit candles and I prayed for him by myself. Of course I was sad about him passing away but all the small rituals I performed helped me to get over it - alone. ‘Cause strangely when it comes to death no one is able to help you, to be with you, to hold you. It’s not about finding the right words to say, it’s just to show a little bit of empathy. We all have suffered the loss of someone, so why can’t people hold strong together - above all in a situation like this?&nbsp;<br>My uncle passed away in August this year, now in the beginning of November another tragic news reached me: My cousins wife shot him, the two eight and six years old sons and at the end herself in the head.&nbsp;<br>It was a brief e-mail from my father in the style of “dear daughter, I hope you’re well and in good health? I have tragic news … I am very sad but life needs to go on. Well I hope you are enjoying your time and in good company. With affection, your dad.”<br>It was on the first day of a three months lasting event with great masters of Tibetan Buddhism, I was still under the symptoms of a slight concussion (means: sensible) and anyhow very emotional because I felt kind of left beside from my parents, who never call me, never write a mail - only if I write first, and now my father couldn’t even try to find out a better way to reach me.<br>I was at shock. No clue how to digest something like this. I went back to the Institute I was staying, logged in and skyped with a good friend who is an excellent psychologist. I asked him to help me, not as a friend but as a professional, and he did very good. When I finally called my dad from my mobile I could hear that he was more shocked to hear my voice than because of the tragic incident and the loss of my cousin who was like a son to him. He called me back once, my mom never called nor made a real attempt to know what happened… My best friend asked me after my Facebook status saying that I have one trauma after another in a mail what happened, but never replied when I told her (by the way: I remembered in this occasion -a few years ago a good friend and his sister were killed also with a shot in the head and I called my best friend, crying and telling her that I was trying to reach him and to reestablish contact but it was too late now… And she just replied something like ‘that sucks, hm!” - now it feels the same…)<br>After two weeks even my friends and buddhist companions around me stopped asking me, if I’m well. I mean, apparently I&nbsp;<em>am</em>, but I don’t want to run around either demanding everyones attention. If they don’t want to, why should I be the annoying girl in need of an ear and a shoulder to talk about how I feel, to cry once again over that event, asking them to help me?! Why is it that people, even the closest ones, just block themselves when it comes to death?&nbsp;<br>There is one really dear friend I am talking to, even through a huge distance and over 9 hours of time difference. He is pretty much the only one who still listens to me. Honestly? I wonder what makes him so different in order to stand me? Because I understand that it must be annoying to listen all the time to an emotional girl, but isn’t it what not only friendship is about, but also empathy, a kind heart being there for someone who needs a little bit of support? I confess: he is like this.<br>Anyhow: It’s been three weeks now, and I still feel like crying. And I cry. Alone. And I retreat from others, from my family, from my friends, from my companions. I retreat because their inability to be there when I could definitely need some support hurts and because I feel that I’m not allowed to demand any attention from anyone (and if I do for example in de with my mother she complains that I’m exaggerating). But also because the teachings and empowerments are really going deep and there is this inner struggle of my ego to survive.&nbsp;<br>Before leaving Mexico to start my journey towards India, I dreamed that I would die. In the dream I wasn’t afraid of dying, nor panicked. I was completely calm and in peace, even when I woke up it felt perfectly fine. A friend interpreted this dream as the actual me dying and she wished that this old&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;would die and a new one would be born. Today, in a moment of perfect loneliness, I cried again (<em>eye roll</em>) but this time because I started to realise, that now,&nbsp;<em>I’m</em>&nbsp;dying. This old, annoying me is being erased and I’m in the hard and sometimes painful process of gesture.&nbsp;<br>Isn’t it with death the same? You struggle to survive because of your clinging and grasping to your ego, your life, possessions etc.? You fight against death or transformation because you are afraid of the change, you are afraid of the unknown, afraid of the next life or person to be.&nbsp;<br>Definitely, I am bloody scared but also curious and looking very much forward to see the result. And I hope that this renewed me will be always compassionate, affective and empathic enough to share the difficult moment of death and loss with others.</p>,<p>Bir, India on November 30, 2012</p>,<p>May these words be for the benefit of all sentient beings.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Travelling in India… as a woman... alone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f2e27715-51cf-42fc-93e8-74cfd44de2d8.jpg">,<h1><strong>Travelling in India… as a woman... alone</strong></h1>,<p>March 29, 2013</p>,<p>Recently there has been lots of news about women being raped in India. It started with one case in December 2012, when a twenty something year old student from New Delhi was group raped in a bus. 5 guys raped her in a bus with no one intervening to stop it, nor even to help her afterwards. If raping her multiple times wasn’t bad enough she was beaten and tortured with an iron stick. When the men were done they threw her off the bus and left her badly injured on the street. If I remember well, even then people who witnessed partially the scene never came to help her – at least not immediately.</p>,<p>I’m not pretending to give a report of her case, I just know that she wasn’t even in an Indian hospital; she was brought into another country to receive the best treatment possible, since her uterus was destroyed and many body parts in severe condition. She was in coma and eventually she died.</p>,<p>This event provoked a reaction of rage among many New Delhi citizens – a lot of them women.</p>,<p>Now there has been the case of the Swiss couple who was making a bike tour through India. In a random village they stopped to camp and pass the night. 8 guys attacked them, handcuffed the husband and group raped the 39 year old women. He had to witness everything. Now a police officer was cynical enough to say that the couple was to be blamed for that! The argument? They were in a place where they shouldn’t have to.</p>,<p>I remember when I was in Bodhgaya, I read a newspaper note about a Spanish girl who was staying in a homestay. An Indian guy came through the balcony into her room, raped and robbed her.</p>,<p>Then I heard of cases during the Kalachakra event (a huge days lasting ceremony with the Dalai Lama in January 2012), that several nuns got raped; as well as I remember that I met two Indian men in Bodhgaya, who were into politics and pretty much known in the town. One was owner of several establishments (food and clothes), the other the chairman of a big NGO. They were interested in knowing me because of my profile and experience in social business; I brought a lot of new ideas of possible projects to do in Bodhgaya and we started to talk about making something together.</p>,<p>One day one of them invited me to a dinner party he would have at his place. After a few months of travelling in India and Nepal I became much more cautious and suspiciously, so I asked him how many people were going. <em>Five friends</em>. And will your wife and the other wives be there as well? <em>No, you know, Indian women have another mentality, India is still different, so Indian women don’t go to parties.</em></p>,<p>I refused to go alone. I thought about what it was about: So Indian women are not allowed or it’s “not their culture” to go to parties, but western women are allowed, or what?!” It didn’t make sense. Or did it? I mean, I have been thinking about it for a long time, and not only because recently there have been so many raping cases. These things have been occurring since a long time, but now finally the world knows about it. Now, more than ever I wonder what would have happened if I would have gone? Trusting in people who seem to be decent, married men? I can’t even imagine, I don’t want to imagine it.</p>,<p>So, the impression that I have now – and I mean in retrospective because it is now, after a several months being back from India, that I am getting awareness of what I’ve experienced and observed – is that most of the Indian society is a big deal twisted in their minds. On one hand guys are allowed to walk hand in hand and hug each other in public, but a married couple is not allowed to show any kind of affection: no hugs, no hand holding, no kissing – that would be obscene!</p>,<p>There are all this funny Bollywood movies where beautiful women are dressed like Britney Spears in her video “Hit me baby one more time”, dancing lascivious with the protagonist hero, seducing each other with looks and touches and all the theatre. But the common Indian couple doesn’t even choose each other because of love rather than of cast and status convenience.</p>,<p>From what I could see is that women are married so men can take their dowry, they cook and have children, sometimes they can be intelligent and study but it doesn’t mean that women get more affection because of that.</p>,<p>In many towns and villages, once the dowry is spent, the women “suddenly caches fire in the kitchen” and she burns to death, or commits mysteriously suicide and the man gets married again. A happy marriage as long as the dowry lasts.</p>,<p>Since women don’t have any status no one wants to have a daughter, that’s why baby girls are murdered.</p>,<p>In a culture where once the Kama sutra was drawn, where temples full of erotic sculptures where built and where in it symbols of phallus and vaginas still are not only represented but also venerated, where sexuality is extremely shown in movies but not practiced at home and where gays are sick and perverted but guys can walk around hugging each other when women or girls are not allowed to do so… I don’t wonder why all this group raping is occurring. The cliché of this open and flexible culture was for me the discovery of a highly repressed and twisted one.</p>,<p>And then there come the western women along. Of course Indians know them from the movies: Hollywood and the liberality. Where in India a women needs to cover practically everything that could provoke, in the west they run around almost naked (at least in the eyes of an Indian). Even if I was warned that I should be careful because Indian men consider western girls as cheap porn stars, I wasn’t fully aware. But yes, I felt treated like a cheap object, like someone with so little value that it is easy to exchange, like someone who has money but no virtues.</p>,<p>I was naïve in many situations, blind in a few and seldom wise enough to not get in trouble while travelling alone in India and Nepal. For sure I have been more dumb than courageous to go alone and travel on my own in a sexist, repressed country.</p>,<p>So eventually I got into a problem. And ironically it wasn’t an Indian man. I mean, I got harassed once by an Indian guy, many tried to flirt with me, one tried to get me to sleep with him, I was stared at by tons but never one single dude tried to force me into something. It was a Tibetan who did it. The whole experience is so embarrassing that I still can’t find the words to write it down. Still I want to do it, because I want to warn other girls and women by sharing my experience. The thing is that it has been a process of coping with an event that implies being manipulated and used and blackmailed and I don’t know what. So bit by bit I am dealing with it, dealing with the shame and the anger, the frustration and self-reproaches. Eventually I hope I will be able to tell my story.</p>,<p>©Kirsten Penaloza</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The day Mila died was the day of a new beginning]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f44c2fd7-bedd-43ab-ac7b-c7d5491463aa.jpg">,<h1><strong>The day Mila died was the day of a new beginning</strong></h1>,<p>It was April the 10th&nbsp;of this year (2013) when Mila, the puppy my now husband Alex and I rescued almost exactly half a year ago, died. This day was full moon and a special and auspicious one for the Tibetan Buddhist Calendar, too.</p>,<p>Alex and I waited since almost 2 weeks for the cherry blossoms in Washington, DC to bloom, and finally the moment came. It was an extraordinary hot day, 30°C, no clouds in the sky, no wind blowing and perfect to find a nice spot in the shadow of the cherry blossom trees on the shore of the small lake.</p>,<p>We walked around, hand in hand, like so many other couples; we took a lot of pictures and finally decided to lie down. We just enjoyed ourselves and the nice atmosphere that was within and outside us.</p>,<p>After a while Alex looked over my shoulder saying that he can’t take his eyes of the beautiful pink tree over there, so I looked around. I saw plenty of white blooming trees but not one single in pink but I thought&nbsp;<em>maybe it’s me</em>… and just replied: “Oh, yes, it’s amazing!”</p>,<p>Then I turned my head back and suddenly Alex was holding a small little box in front of me, opened it (by then I already knew what he was going to ask) and pronounced the unexpected question: “Would you marry me?” I started to cry tears of joy and emotion and said “yes, of course I want!”</p>,<p>He put me the ring on and we hugged and kissed and were happy, enjoying this moment, surrounded by cherry blossom trees, covered with the soft white and pink petals.</p>,<p>We went to have lunch and to celebrate with a beer, we came back home and wanted to do a puja (an offering ritual in Buddhism and Hinduism) to offer this new event in our lives and our love in general to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and spiritual friends.</p>,<p>Once at home I checked quickly my e-mails and Adriana Ferranti from Maitri Charitable Trust in Bodhgaya had written me. As I read the story I couldn’t help it, I started to cry. She just got the news in the morning from her employees in Bodhgaya that a kennel cough spread out in the shelter and Mila got sick along with other puppies. Mila died uncommonly fast.</p>,<p>Joy and sadness came together and we couldn’t avoid thinking and reflecting once again about all the circumstances that brought us two together and how we met Mila. Until now I don’t understand how a little dog I knew for only two days could still have such an impact on me, but I guess there are many unperceivable and inexplicable aspects of a bond with another being.</p>,<p>Was it just another “coincidence” that Mila died exactly the day Alex decided to propose to me and therefore to start something new together? Isn’t it strange that on that day of full moon, where there was said that this was a special and auspicious one to leave the past behind and start something new, Mila died and we began to realise that this engagement is the next step to spend a lifetime together?</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4b1ee75b-240f-4127-8629-0168bc4012e3.jpg">,<p>Could it be possible that Mila had one purpose in this life and this was us? We rescued her from a terrible life in the street in an ugly, yet sacred place in India, we saw by observing each other doing all we did for Mila, how wonderful the other is and this made us fall in love with each other.</p>,<p>Mila taught us many lessons, and even her mere death is a valuable teaching that makes us understand, that death is not the end, it’s the beginning of something new. We hear so often: When a door closes another one opens. But we don’t really understand this line until we experience it fully aware.</p>,<p>And maybe the fact that Mila was part of this amazing and magical encounter with Alex makes her so important to us. She is part of our story, even if the story started long before we rescued her.</p>,<p>It started actually in 2011.</p>,<p>Well, I can also start even before that and you are free to skip that many details.</p>,<p>Still here?</p>,<p>Ok, when I was around 12 years old I bought a diary with the American flag as the cover. From all the stupidities I might have written I remember one thing: I was amazed by the USA. Not that I had a better reference than the Sylvester Stallone movies I saw and that inspired me that everything is possible – even for losers.</p>,<p>I kind of felt like a loser back in that time when I was about to become a teenager. I was ugly – that much ugly that my sister’s classmates used to call me the ugly duck. I felt that most of the people my age were silly and boring, I had a terrible relationship with my mother and I just got to a boarding school in Germany. Even if I can’t complain of not having enough friends, I always had friends, but for some strange reason I always felt like a lonely person. It doesn’t mean that it’s bad or that I hated it, I took it just the way it was.</p>,<p>Anyhow, so I wrote in that diary that one day I would become a historian, that I would like to teach history because it fascinates me and above all I wrote that one day I would like to visit the USA.</p>,<p>A couple of years after, I must have been like 14 years old, I was visiting my father in Mexico during the summer holidays. I don’t remember how we got to talk about this topic but I clearly remember that I told him very serious: “I’m going to marry a gringo one day!” He only laughed at me and said “Ay, hija! From all the nationalities in the world you chose a gringo? No way!” But I was so sure about it, that I didn’t even discuss it with him.</p>,<p>The time went by and I guess the process of growing up (especially when it came to emotions and mind), brought so many distractions, that I completely forgot about it. Then I became this rebel girl, reading intellectual stuff, becoming social critic and as every youngster from a Latin- American background, I too became a fan of Che Guevara, Emiliano Zapata and Subcomandante Marcos.</p>,<p>I was 16 years old, when my friend Diana and I went to this new age, spiritual, psychedelic village near Mexico City called Tepoztlán. Curious as we were we went to the passage where a bunch of wanna be psychic’s were giving hand lectures. Again, I don’t remember anything but one detail. I asked the girl that sometimes I just don’t really have a connection with guys and whenever one appears I just feel like annoyed or even disgusted and I just didn’t know why. She deeply looked into my hand and said: “Of course not! The reason why is that you are waiting for the right one. And [showing me some lines on my hand] the right one will have the initials A and M!”</p>,<p>Believe it or not: For the following years I was searching for someone with that initials, but every time I was with someone, who obviously didn’t bring this special requirement with him, I just told myself that it was anyway a waste of time and money this whole hand lecture thing and what the girl said was just nonsense.</p>,<p>Trying to figure out my own identity, I was not at all interested in the USA and later on, living in Mexico there was nothing at the other side of the northern border that could somehow catch my attention (except of the headlines in the newspaper).</p>,<p>So life went on, love and relationships only brought disappointments and I only started to be in “peace” with that (as far as a latina girl’s mind can be) thanks to Buddhism, meditation (though I’m a lazy practitioner) and my friends.</p>,<p>One day I went to see a friend who is supposed to be psychic, but unfortunately every time she told me about things to be happening soon, she was always wrong. Except for one thing: In a very beautiful way she told me, that obviously I haven’t found the ONE for me, because I was looking in the wrong direction. What I needed to find is someone, who shines as much as I do, and together then we could shine even brighter.</p>,<p>Then finally I went to a retreat on meditation. In one moment an event called “Kalachakra” in Washington DC the same year (it was February of 2011), was announced – I didn’t pay that much attention. Back at my Buddhism classes again someone mentioned it and then I started to wonder what this Kalachakra thing was about but didn’t give that much importance to it. Finally I started to have contact again with a high school friend from Hamburg, Germany and it happened to be that she was living near Washington DC and had just became mother. She offered me to come visit her whenever I wanted, especially when the Dalai Lama would come in the summer and suddenly I thought “wait a minute! Isn’t this strange event with the Dalai Lama the Kalachakra?!” Now I was fully into it: I looked it up, I made my plans, I signed up to volunteer for this event and bought a plane ticket.</p>,<p>For some strange reason I was convinced, that this event would be life changing for me. I had no clue how and why, but it would define the rest of my life.&nbsp;<em>And:</em>&nbsp;I knew deep in my heart and mind, that I would find the love of my life. I was so sure about it, that I talked with this “psychic” friend about it and she only replied “I know, I’m also pretty sure!”</p>,<p>So I went and had the time of my life not only in that event but in general in my first visit to the USA: I saw the Dalai Lama for the first time, volunteered in such a beautiful event with him, I met friends from Boston, made new and lovely acquaintances from around the world, I had fun at Tibetan Dance parties and as a tourist travelling around. But the 11 days at the “Kalachakra” went by and no Mr. Right came along. I visited my friends in Leesburg, not one single interesting gringo around. I went to Boston to see my friends, no one inspired me any feeling of “uh, he must be it”.</p>,<p>After a month being in the USA I came back to Mexico – without having met the guy of my life. But I knew undoubtedly, that&nbsp;<em>something had changed</em>. My life would definitely not be the same again.</p>,<p>Still it would take me more than two more years to understand how all these events are related. I would finally understand how all this makes perfectly sense. And it was the moment when I was walking in Bodhgaya, India with my blue volunteer shirt from the Kalachakra and another tourist recognised it, asked me about it and we started to talk in front of the entrance of the<em>Kalachakra Ground&nbsp;</em>on the main street. As soon as he said that he also volunteered in the same event in Washington DC I was completely thrilled. Something inside me was starting to acknowledge everything, but when he said his name, I knew immediately that the search has finally come to an end. That it doesn’t matter how, when or under which circumstances: He was the man of my life. He was the one, whose initials were tattooed since my birth in my hands…</p>,<p>And after Alex had proposed to me I started to remember all the things I said when I was a 12, 14 or 16 year old girl. Not knowing at all (because I never took me too serious) that my words were pronounced subconsciously and unwillingly as a decree.</p>,<p>And Mila? Maybe now you understand how she is part of this wonderful story? That’s why it hurts to know her dead. There has been so much magic around Alex, me and her that we want to believe to meet her again in this or in a future lifetime.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f41b904f-ec55-491f-bbe8-e85530d3d48b.jpg">,<p>Published May 7, 2013&nbsp;</p>,<p>© Kirsten Penaloza</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/25dec34c-6dc8-4bd7-8940-aef00a92278a.jpg">,<h1><strong>Macho Culture and Childless Women</strong></h1>,<p>May 2017</p>,<p>I just read a<a href="http://www.inspiremore.com/jennifer-aniston-womans-value-letter/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=IWG&amp;utm_campaign=partner"> public post from Jennifer Anniston</a> about her not having children-. It makes me feel better to read her, as I experience this kind of nuisance on a regular basis. I understand that many cultures, such as Latin American or some Asian cultures, believe a woman is only complete when she is a mother and only "woman enough" if she wishes to be a mother.</p>,<p>Macho cultures, where women are equally responsible for the Macho attitude, not only make you believe you have to want to be a mother, because it's natural, its how it's supposed to be, but they also make you believe you're not fulfilling your duty as a good wife, daughter in law or simply as a good citizen.</p>,<p>I continuously get judged, together with my husband, because we take a conscious decision of being happy without children and above all without wanting any.</p>,<p>As if people around us project their own wishes and desires for children in their lives onto others, without even considering that you may feel uncomfortable.</p>,<p>The topic of having children is uncomfortable, because it is very personal. It equals to talking about my sex life, mental health issues in my family or any other sensitive topic I would not discuss openly with anybody who comes along.</p>,<p>The decision of having children is a 100% personal one, not only as a woman, but as a couple, and I don't understand why people feel to have the right of an opinion on this.</p>,<p>It's not that they would have an opinion on my sex life - and if they do they would certainly not share it with me.</p>,<p>So why sharing their opinion as of why I should have children?</p>,<p>It's not that we didn't think about it, not even that we haven't tried. We did! But it didn't happen and the more we thought about it, the less we didn't want children.</p>,<p>We are accused of being selfish because we're not paying our tribute to humanity. I must have missed the all too many orphans out there in need of parents; the over population, the lack of resources, the horrible state of our environment, let alone the political mess my parent's and grandparent's generation is leaving us.</p>,<p>Is there really a need for one child more? I mean honestly, besides my mother in law who pressures us for her sake and wish of having grandchildren, what other need is there for one?</p>,<p>Oh because they are so cute, and you won't be alone when you're old, and they will take care of you!</p>,<p>Essentially the reasons I should have a child is because:</p>,<ul><li>I can't stand to be alone</li><li>I need an insurance and nurse when I'm old</li><li>Humanity will die out</li><li>I need a pet, a doll or any other living toy</li><li>My mother in law is desperate for grandchildren</li></ul>,<p>Wow, convincing reasons.</p>,<p>Have people ever considered that women and couples can be happy without children?</p>,<p>Children are not necessarily the ultimate factor of happiness. And above all they don't need to be a measure point for a successful marriage and the love for each other.</p>,<p>Taking a conscious decision of not having children is acknowledging your needs, desires and wishes, but also your limitations. It is not being selfish, it's called maturity.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Shaved head - courage to be ugly?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Shaved head - courage to be ugly?</strong></h1>,<p>June 2017</p>,<p>Before I begin, I am not pulling a Britney Spears; in other words, I am not going through a rough time, I am not hating myself, I am not going through a divorce or the kind.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/51e7122c-a865-4a1b-8cb1-fa59f3c5b7e9.jpg">,<p>I am also not doing this because I want any other kind of unwanted attention.</p>,<p>The main reason I am shaving my head is, because I want this spiritual experience to teach me something. I don’t know yet what it is or what it will be, maybe I won’t learn anything, but at least I don’t want to regret not having it done at least once in my life.</p>,<p>Many years ago, I went to India to become a Buddhist nun. Well, we all know by now it didn’t happen. Too soon I realized I am not able to follow the outdated rules of monastic life, where women have more vows simply for being women (sounds like Trump and his cabinet are not the only ones to consider being a woman is a pre-existing condition). Nuns are not allowed in certain teachings and empowerments, they are ranked second and third places while many still believe that as a woman you cannot - or with more hardships - reach enlightenment.</p>,<p>I think that’s BS and I didn’t want to commit my life to that, so I turned away and continued to search for something else. But I missed on one experience: Getting my head shaved.</p>,<p>Of course as a lay Buddhist practitioner I am not required to do so, but I wanted to see how it feels to be less attractive (according to society’s beauty standards), how it helps being less vain, how it helps letting go of this ego clinging in times of social-media-self-optimization and obsession with the self.</p>,<p>And so I did it - I shaved my head knowing that at age 36 I am not the prettiest to pull it off, knowing that my husband’s uptight family will openly disapprove and possibly shower me (and him) with all kind of dismissive comments and knowing that microaggressions are coming my way.</p>,<p>My husband helped to shave my head and supports me in this experiment that also has a lot to do with defying people’s idea of how women have to look and have to be.</p>,<p>Before I shaved my head I was nervous, maybe even afraid. As a child I was not really cute, as a teenager I was considered ugly. So I made my “ugliness” my strength and went over to provoke: Short hair, military boots, ska, punk, rude girl.</p>,<p>Eventually I physically became more tolerable, and the ugly duckling became better looking. But unfortunately my family never fully inspired me to see my beauty, to accept me the way I am. Instead I was criticised by my mother that I looked like a slut. Irony is, I was always very prudent and far away from being one.</p>,<p>My father told me I looked too pale, Mexican men said I wasn’t feminine enough. And yet, I got groped, sexually assaulted, and - yes, why not openly speaking about it - raped. So much of being feminine and a woman - I guess it doesn’t matter how you look like, as a woman you always have to deal with sexism.</p>,<p>It took me going to India, to break into pieces and patch myself up again. It took me getting married, suffering depression, self hatred and eventually seeking therapy. Above all that, it took one person to tell me every single day without failure, that I am beautiful and it was until then, I started to see beauty in myself: My husband.</p>,<p>And that’s where I am now: Centered, strong, and with enough self esteem to endure whatever comes.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33e5aa43-4ca4-4b01-95b2-d22e693da716.jpg">]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Why I don't like Valentine's Day]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why I don't like Valentine's Day</h1>,<p>My dear husband and soul mate,</p>,<p>While everybody is celebrating the day of love, buying the biggest flower bouquet or chocolate box, the most tacky valentine's card with cheesy phrases and posting tons of corny love related videos on Facebook, I’m sitting here and think about how much I don’t like this day. Before I met you I didn’t like it because I detest the idea to commercialize something so wonderful as it is love and friendship.</p>,<p>Now that you are my husband I don’t like it either, because I’ve realized that there is no bouquet beautiful enough to compete with your beauty. And not only because you are the hottest husband on earth (of course for me and my taste), but because your inner beauty is just not comparable with anything in the world. I don’t want to buy a chocolate box, because there is just nothing material, not even non-material, that can ever express the deep love I feel for you.</p>,<p>In other words, it seems that there is just absolutely nothing with which I can measure your greatness and the importance you have for me.</p>,<p>It doesn’t matter what I buy and what I do it would never be enough, because you are the best and greatest thing that ever happened to me.</p>,<p>Today is just another day, no - not "just", but fortunately another day in which I can tell you that I LOVE YOU. With every breath, with every cell, with every thought, I LOVE YOU.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0825633a-a232-47e2-8cf0-0feec46fe935.jpg">,<p>I don't like Valentine's Day, because I just don't find a way in which I can fully show how much I love you. It frustrates me, because this day evidences how limited I am when it comes to expressing all this and more. It makes me sad that there is nothing else I can do than simply write this blog and share it with the world: You.</p>,<p>Published February 2014</p>]]></description>
