            <title><![CDATA[Abuse in Buddhism]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0dd34fed-b489-46a3-a500-4cc190979fa7.jpg">,<h1>Abuse in Buddhism</h1>,<p>I just read about the <a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/letter-to-sogyal-rinpoche-from-current-and-ex-rigpa-members-details-abuse-allegations/">open letter</a> from students of Sogyal Rinpoche, in which they mention in 12 pages physical, emotional and sexual abuse from him.</p>,<p>I have first hand experienced an abusive lama, who used his position to manipulate me into a sexual relationship. It was NOT a Rinpoche - to state this very clear! - nonetheless a lama.</p>,<p>I have also seen and experienced how high masters misuse donations to build big mansions and there are known issues with this with India's government. Such case was one in Bir, resulting in all foreign visitors having to get a permit from the government to visit Tibetan settlements, with the mean to control and track from where donations came from and what they do with them.</p>,<p>It is an "open secret" that many lamas and high masters have been using their position to abuse their students in many ways. I know of people who have been blackmailed by their sanghas to remain silent, who have been bullied and forced out of their communities when they spoke up. I also know of so many misconducts of lamas, khenpos, rinpoches, etc. who get involved with their students or even translators, with the concept of having "dakinis" and practicing "tantric forms of Buddhism".</p>,<p>We cried out loud when those behaviors became so evident in priests - we couldn't longer ignore them, when the Catholic church and community tried to silent those allegations.</p>,<p>But now that it hits home we try to ignore the facts, we blame the victims, because victim shaming is easier than to see and accept the truth, and we try to dehumanize, humiliate not only the victims, but also the "press" that publishes those articles almost in a Trumpanian way.</p>,<p>I don't know in person Sogyal Rinpoche and his sangha, and while I believe that for certain he has done many great things, I also am very reluctant to believe he is a saint. When so many people speak out, there is something behind it.</p>,<p>As Westerners we tend to romanticize Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and the culture, we put our teachers on altars and we are taught that questioning them and seeing them as impure beings is just our own dirty mind projecting our impurity to them.<br>I think this is just another way of manipulating our mind, of emotionally being blackmailed to believe we are the ones at fault.</p>,<p>Institutionalized victim shaming is the most dangerous form and although I am still a Buddhist, I still follow Tibetan Buddhism, I also refuse to be a blind follower and support this institutionalized religion.</p>,<p>Published July 2017</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Shaved head - courage to be ugly?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Shaved head - courage to be ugly?</strong></h1>,<p>Before I begin, I am not pulling a Britney Spears; in other words, I am not going through a rough time, I am not hating myself, I am not going through a divorce or the kind.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/51e7122c-a865-4a1b-8cb1-fa59f3c5b7e9.jpg">,<p>I am also not doing this because I want any other kind of unwanted attention.</p>,<p>The main reason I am shaving my head is, because I want this spiritual experience to teach me something. I don’t know yet what it is or what it will be, maybe I won’t learn anything, but at least I don’t want to regret not having it done at least once in my life.</p>,<p>Many years ago, I went to India to become a Buddhist nun. Well, we all know by now it didn’t happen. Too soon I realized I am not able to follow the outdated rules of monastic life, where women have more vows simply for being women (sounds like Trump and his cabinet are not the only ones to consider being a woman is a pre-existing condition). Nuns are not allowed in certain teachings and empowerments, they are ranked second and third places while many still believe that as a woman you cannot - or with more hardships - reach enlightenment.</p>,<p>I think that’s BS and I didn’t want to commit my life to that, so I turned away and continued to search for something else. But I missed on one experience: Getting my head shaved.</p>,<p>Of course as a lay Buddhist practitioner I am not required to do so, but I wanted to see how it feels to be less attractive (according to society’s beauty standards), how it helps being less vain, how it helps letting go of this ego clinging in times of social-media-self-optimization and obsession with the self.</p>,<p>And so I did it - I shaved my head knowing that at age 36 I am not the prettiest to pull it off, knowing that my husband’s uptight family will openly disapprove and possibly shower me (and him) with all kind of dismissive comments and knowing that microaggressions are coming my way.</p>,<p>My husband helped to shave my head and supports me in this experiment that also has a lot to do with defying people’s idea of how women have to look and have to be.</p>,<p>Before I shaved my head I was nervous, maybe even afraid. As a child I was not really cute, as a teenager I was considered ugly. So I made my “ugliness” my strength and went over to provoke: Short hair, military boots, ska, punk, rude girl.</p>,<p>Eventually I physically became more tolerable, and the ugly duckling became better looking. But unfortunately my family never fully inspired me to see my beauty, to accept me the way I am. Instead I was criticised by my mother that I looked like a slut. Irony is, I was always very prudent and far away from being one.</p>,<p>My father told me I looked too pale, Mexican men said I wasn’t feminine enough. And yet, I got groped, sexually assaulted, and - yes, why not openly speaking about it - raped. So much of being feminine and a woman - I guess it doesn’t matter how you look like, as a woman you always have to deal with sexism.</p>,<p>It took me going to India, to break into pieces and patch myself up again. It took me getting married, suffering depression, self hatred and eventually seeking therapy. Above all that, it took one person to tell me every single day without failure, that I am beautiful and it was until then, I started to see beauty in myself: My husband.</p>,<p>And that’s where I am now: Centered, strong, and with enough self esteem to endure whatever comes.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33e5aa43-4ca4-4b01-95b2-d22e693da716.jpg">,<p>Published June 2017</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Macho Culture and Childless Women]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Macho Culture and Childless Women</strong></h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/25dec34c-6dc8-4bd7-8940-aef00a92278a.jpg">,<p>I just read a<a href="http://www.inspiremore.com/jennifer-aniston-womans-value-letter/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=IWG&amp;utm_campaign=partner"> public post from Jennifer Anniston</a> about her not having children-. It makes me feel better to read her, as I experience this kind of nuisance on a regular basis. I understand that many cultures, such as Latin American or some Asian cultures, believe a woman is only complete when she is a mother and only "woman enough" if she wishes to be a mother.</p>,<p>Macho cultures, where women are equally responsible for the Macho attitude, not only make you believe you have to want to be a mother, because it's natural, its how it's supposed to be, but they also make you believe you're not fulfilling your duty as a good wife, daughter in law or simply as a good citizen.</p>,<p>I continuously get judged, together with my husband, because we take a conscious decision of being happy without children and above all without wanting any.</p>,<p>As if people around us project their own wishes and desires for children in their lives onto others, without even considering that you may feel uncomfortable.</p>,<p>The topic of having children is uncomfortable, because it is very personal. It equals to talking about my sex life, mental health issues in my family or any other sensitive topic I would not discuss openly with anybody who comes along.</p>,<p>The decision of having children is a 100% personal one, not only as a woman, but as a couple, and I don't understand why people feel to have the right of an opinion on this.</p>,<p>It's not that they would have an opinion on my sex life - and if they do they would certainly not share it with me.</p>,<p>So why sharing their opinion as of why I should have children?</p>,<p>It's not that we didn't think about it, not even that we haven't tried. We did! But it didn't happen and the more we thought about it, the less we didn't want children.</p>,<p>We are accused of being selfish because we're not paying our tribute to humanity. I must have missed the all too many orphans out there in need of parents; the over population, the lack of resources, the horrible state of our environment, let alone the political mess my parent's and grandparent's generation is leaving us.</p>,<p>Is there really a need for one child more? I mean honestly, besides my mother in law who pressures us for her sake and wish of having grandchildren, what other need is there for one?</p>,<p>Oh because they are so cute, and you won't be alone when you're old, and they will take care of you!</p>,<p>Essentially the reasons I should have a child is because:</p>,<ul><li>I can't stand to be alone</li><li>I need an insurance and nurse when I'm old</li><li>Humanity will die out</li><li>I need a pet, a doll or any other living toy</li><li>My mother in law is desperate for grandchildren</li></ul>,<p>Wow, convincing reasons.</p>,<p>Have people ever considered that women and couples can be happy without children?</p>,<p>Children are not necessarily the ultimate factor of happiness. And above all they don't need to be a measure point for a successful marriage and the love for each other.</p>,<p>Taking a conscious decision of not having children is acknowledging your needs, desires and wishes, but also your limitations. It is not being selfish, it's called maturity.</p>,<p>Published: May 2017</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Why I don't like Valentine's Day]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why I don't like Valentine's Day</h1>,<p>My dear husband and soul mate,</p>,<p>While everybody is celebrating the day of love, buying the biggest flower bouquet or chocolate box, the most tacky valentine's card with cheesy phrases and posting tons of corny love related videos on Facebook, I’m sitting here and think about how much I don’t like this day. Before I met you I didn’t like it because I detest the idea to commercialize something so wonderful as it is love and friendship.</p>,<p>Now that you are my husband I don’t like it either, because I’ve realized that there is no bouquet beautiful enough to compete with your beauty. And not only because you are the hottest husband on earth (of course for me and my taste), but because your inner beauty is just not comparable with anything in the world. I don’t want to buy a chocolate box, because there is just nothing material, not even non-material, that can ever express the deep love I feel for you.</p>,<p>In other words, it seems that there is just absolutely nothing with which I can measure your greatness and the importance you have for me.</p>,<p>It doesn’t matter what I buy and what I do it would never be enough, because you are the best and greatest thing that ever happened to me.</p>,<p>Today is just another day, no - not "just", but fortunately another day in which I can tell you that I LOVE YOU. With every breath, with every cell, with every thought, I LOVE YOU.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0825633a-a232-47e2-8cf0-0feec46fe935.jpg">,<p>I don't like Valentine's Day, because I just don't find a way in which I can fully show how much I love you. It frustrates me, because this day evidences how limited I am when it comes to expressing all this and more. It makes me sad that there is nothing else I can do than simply write this blog and share it with the world: You.</p>,<p>Published February 2014</p>]]></description>
