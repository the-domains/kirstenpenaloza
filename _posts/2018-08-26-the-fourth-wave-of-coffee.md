# The Fourth Wave of Coffee

When you hear "The Fourth Wave", a term defined for the first time by Trish Rothgeb, you imagine some kind of science fiction scenario from a movie with aliens invading earth in waves. And although this wave is taking over a well-known area of our lives, it refers more to a new era of coffee making and serving, but more so the relationship between the consumer and coffee as a product.

The previous waves, therefore, explain how Americans consumed coffee and how their consumer habits changed significantly over time. Although each wave represents an evolution in the relationship with coffee, it does not mean that the particular era is over by the new wave coming into existence.  
Each wave is rather an addition to the existing one(s), even if any new wave becomes potentially the predominant one for that era.

To understand how we got to the Fourth Wave, let's take a look at the previous waves.  
**The First Wave** refers to how coffee became a "mainstream" product around the turn of the century. Not this century, the last one.

Everyone started to offer it, and everyone started to drink it. Folger's became part of the American lifestyle, coffee was part of your day, even if - in retrospective - it tasted pretty awful.

In the second half of the century, different brands entered the market and with brand recognition coffee started to have a qualitative "distinguished taste". Espresso and cappuccino were in demand and "going to grab a coffee" got popular.  
The coffee bar and chains like Starbucks were born all riding **the Second Wave**.

In **the Third Wave** of coffee we see the introduction of deluxe coffee brands, artisan coffee, and highly expensive coffee, therefore, the consumer being an expert much like a wine connoisseur.  
You have now not only the consumer as an expert in knowing different kinds of coffee, roasts, or quality but also the increased interest in the multiple applications to brew coffee at home.  
Besides experimenting with a french press, espresso maker, filter coffee, cold brew, coffee pods, and anything in between you can imagine, consumers started to be aware and becoming concerned with the origin of coffee beans. Questions like where they come from and how the coffee production looks like, whether it's organic, fair trade, or sustainably sourced, are now increasingly more important. This may be the reason as of why we are now seeing the rise of a "New Wave" - the Fourth Wave.

Consuming coffee is nowadays not just a matter of drinking it to stay awake, it's a question of lifestyle. The "hipsterization" of coffee that inspires coffee roasters and baristas to continuously introduce new kinds of coffee, such as a nitrogen infused one, leads at the same time to look beyond our to-go-coffee-mug.  
Especially the Millennials are showing a big interest in sustainable farming, organic and healthy ingredients, and furthermore, the ethically sourced and produced goods. Consumers want to be sure they support local roasters, small coffee shops, and social businesses that ideally give back to the community or support any other good cause.

There is not yet a consensus as to what exactly **the Fourth Wave of Coffee** means, however, the tendency seems to be moving away from the classical chain of "coffee producer to consumer" that includes the middle man and the retailer. Instead, the new model is circular, where all involved parties win and above all where the consumer takes interest in the coffee farmer and production.  
The interest shown can be for example just buying fair trade, organic, locally roasted coffee, or directly supporting social businesses where you further see the favorable impact on the families, the communities, as well as the environment.

How exactly the Fourth Wave will look like, what the impact will be, and how the consumer relates to it, is yet to be seen, but it definitely looks promising.
